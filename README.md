# MeArm-Robotic Arm Control

## Overview
[cite_start]This project involves the design and implementation of an industrial robotic arm controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. [cite: 4] [cite_start]The innovation lies in the utilization of four variable resistors as the primary interface, allowing seamless and intuitive control over the robotic arm's movements. [cite: 10]

## Academic Context
* [cite_start]**University:** Sana'a University [cite: 224]
* [cite_start]**Faculty:** Faculty of Engineering [cite: 218]
* [cite_start]**Department:** Electricity Dep, Computer and Control [cite: 214, 215]
* [cite_start]**Author:** Mohammed Arif [cite: 228]
* **Supervisors:** Dr. Mohammed Al-Yadumi & Eng. [cite_start]Ali-Al-Yaqahbi [cite: 230, 231]

## Components Used
* [cite_start]4 x SG90 servo motors [cite: 16]
* [cite_start]Arduino microcontroller [cite: 17]
* [cite_start]4 x variable resistors [cite: 18]
* [cite_start]Breadboard and jumper wires [cite: 19]
* [cite_start]Power supply [cite: 20]
* [cite_start]Mechanical arm structure [cite: 21]

## How It Works
[cite_start]The system uses an Arduino to control four servo motors using an array of analog sensors. [cite: 149] [cite_start]The code reads the analog values from the sensors (A0, A1, A2, A3) and maps them to an angle value between 0 and 180 degrees. [cite: 150] [cite_start]The angle value is then used to control the corresponding servo motor. [cite: 151]

## Potential Applications
